# Genetic Creature Simulator

This is still being developed, most functionalities listed here are not yet available.

This project is a simulation of creatures that evolve over time using genetic algorithms. The simulation starts with a randomly generated population of creatures, and each generation the creatures' genetic code is passed on to the next generation with small random variations. Over time, the creatures will evolve to better fit their environment and survive longer.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) version 3.5.2 or higher installed on your machine to run this project.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Godot Engine.
3. Press the "Play" button to start the simulation.

### Customization

You can customize the simulation by changing the parameters in the `config.gd` file. This includes the population size, mutation rate, and other variables that affect the evolution of the creatures.

### Built With

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) - The game engine used

### Authors

## Usage

The creatures in the simulation are controlled by a genetic algorithm that determines their movement and behavior. Each creature has a unique genetic code that is passed on to the next generation with small random variations. Over time, the creatures will evolve to better fit their environment and survive longer.

The simulation starts with a randomly generated population of creatures. The creatures move around the environment and must avoid obstacles to survive. As the simulation progresses, the creatures that are better able to survive and reproduce will pass on their genetic code to the next generation.

You can also interact with the simulation by clicking on the creatures to view their genetic code and statistics.

Enjoy the simulation and have fun
